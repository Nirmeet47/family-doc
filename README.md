# 🛡️ Family Doc

**Family Doc** is a secure, family-centric document vault designed to simplify how families store and manage important personal documents — like Aadhar cards, PANs, health records, school certificates, insurance policies, and more.

It allows each user to maintain a digital folder for every family member, making documents accessible, organized, and safe from loss — all in one centralized and responsive web app.

## 💡 Why Family Doc?

Managing physical documents for every family member is chaotic — papers get misplaced, drives become cluttered, and crucial files are hard to retrieve when needed most (travel, hospital visits, official verifications, etc.).

**Family Doc solves this** by:
- Digitally organizing documents per family member
- Offering secure access via Firebase Auth
- Providing a smooth, distraction-free UI for managing uploads
- Storing documents safely using Firebase Storage

- **Firebase** — Authentication, Firestore (family data), and Storage (files)
